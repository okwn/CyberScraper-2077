4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install
   ```

### Setting Up with Docker

1. Build the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t cyberscraper2077 .
   ```

2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

3. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY -e GOOGLE_API_KEY cyberscraper2077
   ```
